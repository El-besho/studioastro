## 🔄 Complete Process Flow

### Phase 1: Content Processing & Indexing
-   **Content Ingestion:** All content (services, blog posts, keywords) is processed.
-   **Arabic NLP:** The NLP Processor analyzes and enriches the content with semantic meaning.
-   **Semantic Embeddings:** Content is converted into 768-dimensional vector embeddings.
-   **Index Building:** The vectors are stored in a specialized index for rapid similarity searching.

### Phase 2: User Query Processing
-   **User Query:** A user enters a search query (e.g., "افضل شركة تلميع رخام بالرياض").
-   **Arabic Analysis:** The NLP Processor deconstructs the query, identifying entities (Service: "تلميع رخام", Location: "الرياض", Intent: "Best").
-   **Semantic Search:** The system generates a vector for the query and searches the index for the most semantically similar and relevant content.
-   **Results Ranking:** Results are scored and ranked based on semantic relevance, entity overlap, and SEO authority.

### Phase 3: SEO & Content Optimization
-   **Keyword Strategy Integration:** The system leverages the keyword database to inform content generation and on-page optimization.
-   **Automated Content Generation:** New pages are created by the AI system using pre-defined, SEO-optimized templates.
-   **Structured Data:** All generated content is automatically marked up with the appropriate Schema.org structured data (`Service`, `FAQPage`, `LocalBusiness`, etc.).
-   **Performance Monitoring:** The system continuously tracks keyword rankings and user engagement to refine its strategy.
