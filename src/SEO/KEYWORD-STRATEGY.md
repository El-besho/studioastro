# SEO Keyword Strategy

This document outlines the strategic approach to keyword research, classification, and implementation for the LeadFlow AI platform. It serves as a practical guide for content generation and SEO optimization efforts.

## 1. Keyword Sources

Our keyword database is sourced from a combination of:
-   **Primary Competitor Analysis:** Scraping and analyzing the keyword profiles of direct and indirect competitors in the Saudi market.
-   **Google Keyword Planner:** Extracting high-volume and long-tail keywords directly from Google's advertising platform.
-   **SERP Analysis:** Manually and automatically analyzing search engine results pages (SERPs) for "People Also Ask" sections, related searches, and auto-complete suggestions.
-   **Internal Search Data:** Analyzing queries typed directly into our platform's search bar to understand user intent.

## 2. Keyword Classification

All keywords are processed and classified according to several axes:

### By Type:
-   **Primary (Pillar) Keywords:** Broad, high-volume terms that define a main service category (e.g., `صيانة مكيفات`, `شركة تنظيف`). These are used for main service pages.
-   **Secondary (Cluster) Keywords:** More specific terms that describe sub-services (e.g., `تعبئة فريون`, `غسيل كنب`). These are used for sub-service pages.
-   **Local Keywords:** Terms that include a geographic modifier (e.g., `سباك في الرياض`, `كهربائي قريب مني`). These are used to generate city-specific landing pages and for local SEO signals.
-   **Long-Tail Keywords:** Highly specific, multi-word phrases that indicate strong user intent (e.g., `كم سعر تركيب مكيف سبليت 2 طن`, `أفضل شركة لمكافحة النمل الأبيض قبل البناء`). These are primarily used for blog posts, FAQs, and targeted content.

### By User Intent:
-   **Informational:** User is looking for information (e.g., "طريقة تنظيف دكت التكييف", "ما هي علامات تسرب المياه").
-   **Navigational:** User is looking for a specific brand or company (e.g., "شركة إنقاذ للخدمات").
-   **Commercial Investigation:** User is comparing services or providers (e.g., "أفضل شركة تنظيف بالرياض", "مقارنة اسعار جلي الرخام").
-   **Transactional:** User is ready to hire or buy (e.g., "اطلب فني تكييف", "حجز خدمة نقل عفش").

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### A. Pillar Pages & Topic Clusters
-   Each main service (e.g., "صيانة مكيفات") has a **Pillar Page**.
-   This pillar page serves as a hub and links out to more specific **Cluster Pages** (sub-services like "تعبئة فريون" or city pages like "صيانة مكيفات في جدة").
-   This structure builds topical authority and creates a strong, semantically-linked internal linking structure.

### B. On-Page SEO
-   **Title Tags:** Must include the primary keyword and location (if applicable).
-   **Meta Descriptions:** Must be compelling, include the primary keyword, and have a clear call-to-action.
-   **H1 Tags:** Should be the main headline of the page and contain the primary keyword.
-   **H2/H3 Tags:** Should target secondary and long-tail keywords, often structured as questions.
-   **Content Body:** Keywords should be used naturally throughout the text. The goal is semantic relevance, not keyword stuffing.
-   **Image Alt Text:** Must be descriptive and include relevant keywords where appropriate.

### C. Content Generation
-   The **AI Content Generation System** uses this strategy to automatically create pages.
-   For a query like "أفضل شركة تنظيف كنب بالرياض", the system knows to:
    -   Target the `تنظيف كنب` sub-service page.
    -   Apply the `الرياض` location entity.
    -   Use a page template optimized for "Best of" (أفضل) commercial queries, likely including comparison points and customer reviews.
-   FAQs for service pages are generated by selecting relevant informational long-tail keywords.

### D. Monitoring and Refinement
-   Keyword performance is tracked continuously.
-   Underperforming keywords or pages are flagged for re-optimization.
-   New keywords identified from internal search data and SERP analysis are constantly added to the database and used to generate new content.
